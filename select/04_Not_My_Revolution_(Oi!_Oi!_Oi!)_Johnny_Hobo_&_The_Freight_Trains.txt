I say I've got nothing to live for like, there's someone who does. I say I feel so betrayed like there's someone that's safe to trust. And I'm not for inaction, but I am for despair. May this resignation lead us to battle against forces we know will destroy us before they really know we're there. I'm fighting for something between apocalypses and liberation.
